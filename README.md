# Class Information Digitalize Project (Archived)

## Summary

This Web Project is now archived, it was intended to provide information about homework and upcoming tests, exams schedule digitally for my form 2 & 3 classmates.

## Why it was called 'Qantas'?

I was one of the monitors in our class. My classmates liked to call me 'Captain' at that time. Plus, as my favourite airliner was Qantas, an Australian Airline Company, I imagined the whole classroom into an aeroplane, my classmates as passengers or cabin crew. And this piece of Web Project could be seen as 'the inflight information system'.
